      <p>
        Consider a simulation of paint splatter drawn as a collection of colored
        dots. Most of the paint clusters around a central position, but some
        dots splatter out toward the edges. Can you use a normal distribution of
        random numbers to generate the positions of the dots? Can you also use a
        normal distribution of random numbers to generate a color palette? Try
        creating a slider to adjust the standard deviation.
